TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.009 ns between Projet_i/Horloge_0/U0/CPTcie/Qtmp_reg[5]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and Projet_i/Horloge_0/U0/jrs_max_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -4.095 ns between Projet_i/Horloge_0/U0/CPTcie/Qtmp_reg[1]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and Projet_i/Horloge_0/U0/C6_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
