## Project Description

This project is a digital clock (Horloge Digitale) designed and implemented using VHDL in Vivado. It serves as a practical application of hardware description language skills and digital system design concepts learned during my studies. The clock displays hours, minutes, and seconds on seven-segment displays, with precise timing and control logic implemented in FPGA.

## Features and Functionality

- **Timekeeping:** Accurately counts and displays hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Seven-Segment Display Control:** Drives multiple seven-segment displays to show the current time in digital format.
- **Modular VHDL Design:** Components such as counters, multiplexers, and decoders are designed separately for clarity and reuse.
- **FPGA Implementation:** Synthesized and tested on an FPGA development board using Vivado.
- **Reset and Enable Controls:** Supports reset functionality to initialize the clock and enable/disable counting.

## Execution and Technologies

- **Hardware Description Language:** VHDL is used for all design and implementation.
- **Development Environment:** Xilinx Vivado for simulation, synthesis, and implementation.
- **Target Device:** FPGA board (e.g., Nexys A7 or similar).
- **Simulation Tools:** Vivado built-in simulator for waveform analysis and functional verification.
- **Design Methodology:** Modular, hierarchical design separating clock generation, counting, and display driving.

## New Skills and Research Areas

- Designing synchronous digital systems with VHDL.
- Implementing multiplexed seven-segment display controllers.
- FPGA development flow including synthesis and implementation constraints.
- Timing analysis and resource optimization on FPGA.
- Debugging and simulating hardware designs with Vivado.

## Project Roles

- Sole developer and designer of the entire project.

## Outcome Expectations

- **Good Outcome:** A fully working digital clock displaying accurate time with basic reset functionality.
- **Better Outcome:** Clean modular VHDL code, successful synthesis on FPGA, and well-tested simulation results.
- **Best Outcome:** Enhanced features such as adjustable time setting, low power consumption, and polished FPGA implementation with a user-friendly interface.
